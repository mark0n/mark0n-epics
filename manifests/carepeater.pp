# @summary Install and run the EPICS Channel Access Repeater
#
# Running the Channel Access Repeater is often useful on workstations and other
# computers running multiple Channel Access clients. It forwards beacons to
# multiple clients which allows all clients running on the machine to be
# notified when IOCs are started or stopped. This often leads to faster
# reconnects after IOC restarts. See the
# [Channel Access Reference Manual](https://epics.anl.gov/base/R7-0/3-docs/CAref.html#Repeater)
# for details.
#
# In some cases installing the package containing the Channel Access Repeater
# executable might be sufficient to start the Channel Access Repeater service.
# However, this class provides more fine-grained control allowing users to run
# the service on a custom port or under a different user. It can also ensure the
# service is actually running (e.g. if a sysadmin stops it and forgets to start
# it after the maintenance work is finished).
#
# @example Ensure Channel Access Repeater is running
#   include epics::carepeater
#
# @example Ensure Channel Access Repeater is not running
#   class { 'epics::carepeater':
#     ensure => 'stopped',
#     enable => false,
#   }
#
# @example Ensure Channel Access Repeater is running with custom port and user
#   class { 'epics::carepeater':
#     port => 5077,
#     user => 'epics',
#   }
#
# @param ensure
#   Specifies whether the Channel Access Repeater service should be running.
#   Valid values are 'running', 'stopped'. Defaults to 'running'.
#
# @param enable
#   Whether the Channel Access Repeater service should be enabled. This
#   determines if the service is started on system boot. Valid values are true,
#   false. Defaults to true.
#
# @param executable
#   Channel Access Repeater executable. Defaults to '/usr/bin/caRepeater'.
#
# @param port
#   Port that the Channel Access Repeater will listen on. This is setting the
#   value of the `EPICS_CA_REPEATER_PORT` environment variable. Defaults to
#   5065.
#
# @param dropin_file_ensure
#   EPICS Base comes with a systemd service file that allows Channel Access
#   Repeater to be started. However, by itself it doesn't allow its
#   configuration to be tweaked (e.g. custom port, user name etc.). This class
#   thus augments the systemd service file that comes with EPICS with a drop-in
#   file allowing for additional configuration. This parameter controls whether
#   this drop-in file should exist or not. Please refer to the
#   [camptocamp/systemd documentation](https://forge.puppet.com/camptocamp/systemd#drop-in-files)
#   for details. Defaults to 'present'.
#
# @param user
#   User that the Channel Access Repeater service will run as. Defaults to
#   'nobody'.
